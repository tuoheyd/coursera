Created for the Johns Hopkins Get Data R class

This file, codebook.md, run_analysis.r and tidydata.csv were created to fulfill the requirements of Coursera’s “Getting and Cleaning Data Class” (May 2014) presented by Dr Jeffery Leeks of the Johns Hopkins University.

Please see the file codebook.md for the background information and details of the program structure.  The actual script file is also well commented with details of the program’s logic.

To execute the program the dataset’s folder “UCI HAR Dataset” must be located in R’s working directory.  From R’s command line load the source file source(“run_analysis.R”) and the script will run automatically generating the resultant file “Tidydata.csv” in the working directory.
